# :moneybag: FINSTAB: Financial Stability & Budgeting
This application is my CSUF MSE Graduation Project.

It serves as a one stop shop for users to be able to add budget categories and their expenses.
In addition it provides budgeting tools such as an expenses calculator and savings goal calculator.

The expenses calculator allows users to input their gross salary and receive a breakdown of how they should allocate their income in order to properly address their essential expenses, retirement contributions, emergency funds, and discretionary spending.

The savings goal calculator allows users to input their target savings goal and the target date they would like to achieve their target by and receive a breakdown of how much they will need to save per month and for how many months in order to achieve their goal.
